A [Simon Blackburn]({% post_url 2020-01-07-simon-blackburn-think %})-féle durván absztrakt filozofálás után úgy gondoltam, kész felüdülés lesz visszakanyarodni kicsit praktikusabb vizekre.
De az egy-egy konkrét témát mélyen kiveséző, vagy a _meséből tanulságot levonós_ jellegű könyvek helyett azért még mindig az átfogó, stabil alapot adó műfaj volt a cél.
Így kötöttem ki végül a Flow-nál, ami nem csak egy általánosan nagyra tartott "alapmű", de az egyik legöregebb elem a "na ezt egyszer biztos el kell olvasni" listámon.
Szóval ha valamikor úgyis, akkor miért ne most?





## Preface

- this book is the result of decades of research on psychology and related field about how to live a good life
- aimed at the general public, technical notes (and research citations) are at the end

## Chapter 1 - Happiness Revisited

- our understanding of happiness is basically at the same level it was in Aristotle's time
- "when do people feel most happy?" --> modern psychology to the rescue
- happiness is something that we MAKE happen
- flow is being lost in an activity so much that outside distractions kind of disappear
- the data the book is based on is a lot of field recordings (questionnaires, empirical experiments, interviews)
- the social impact and interdisciplinary utilization is already quite extensive --> they're on to something here!
- how-to's are not good, because even if they work, you end up at square one without having learned to appreciate your life
- the structure of the book is
    - learning to control your own mind
    - learning how to "order" it to overcome specific challenges
    - learning what the flow state requires, and how to attain it in many different areas of life
    - how to connect these areas in a meaningful pattern, to reach a "happy life"
- as usual, the theory is easy, but the implementation will be hard
- frustration and the never-ending need for more are two basic human realities
    - religion, philosophy, and art are "defense mechanisms"
    - the blueprints are not perfect, and not permanent
    - but without the blueprint it is even worse --> hedonistic pleasure-seeking cannot be the answer
- the universe is indifferent, external control is an illusion
- over-reliance on the external shields (defense mechanisms) like religion, traditions, cultural norms, etc. only make the inevitable "awakening" harsher
    - the real problem is lack of inner order
- external progress (richest generation, most technologically advanced civilization, etc) can't make us happy
    - but on the contrary, external setbacks don't have to make us miserable either
- a shitload of statistics support that we're in decline
- we have to break free from the societal norms and take responsibility for our own lives
    - lots of examples how society is controlling us through our search for pleasure and avoidance of pain
    - not one bit better than religion, only less mystical...
- and not only society either; we have to break free from our own bodies and mental impulses as well
    - design our own set of values
- "control of consciousness determines quality of life"
    - Stoicism, Christianity, Psychoanalysis, Yoga, Taoism, Zen, ...
- okay, so if this is so well known, why isn't it more widespread?
    - this is not cumulative -- everyone has to arrive here themselves (knowing is not enough... like for athletes)
    - this is context-dependent -- every culture has to apply the main principles again and again

### Quotes

It does not depend on outside events, but, rather, on how we interpret them.
--> stoicism again!

The best moments usually occur when a person’s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile.

But in the long run optimal experiences add up to a sense of mastery—or perhaps better, a sense of participation in determining the content of life—that comes as close to what is usually meant by happiness as anything else we can conceivably imagine.

“The universe is not hostile, nor yet is it friendly,” in the words of J. H. Holmes. “It is simply indifferent.”

These days every household in the “first world” has access to the recipes of the feasts of past emperors. But does this make us more satisfied?

there is no inherent problem in our desire to escalate our goals, as long as we enjoy the struggle along the way. The problem arises when people are so fixated on what they want to achieve that they cease to derive pleasure from the present. When that happens, they forfeit their chance of contentment.

If values and institutions no longer provide as supportive a framework as they once did, each person must use whatever tools are available to carve out a meaningful, enjoyable life.

individuals must become independent of the social environment to the degree that they no longer respond exclusively in terms of its rewards and punishments.

achieving control over experience requires a drastic change in attitude about what is important and what is not.
--> personal values instead of the default!

A thoroughly socialized person is one who desires only the rewards that others around him have agreed he should

He may encounter thousands of potentially fulfilling experiences, but he fails to notice them because they are not the things he desires. What matters is not what he has now, but what he might obtain if he does as others want him to do.



## Chapter 2 - The Anatomy of Consciousness

- "a phenomenological model of consciousness based on information theory"
    - phenomenology, as in, we look at the event that happen, not HOW they happen (i.e., brain chemistry, anatomy, etc.)
    - but with information theory, as in, data processing and storage, attention, and memory
- consciousness is a kind of filter for our sensory input, and we have the power to intentionally "order" that information
- consciousness is limited (otherwise we could live infinite lives per second), so we should be mindful of what we let inside
- attention = the process of selecting relevant bits of information, recalling matching stuff from our memory, evaluating the situation, making a decision about what to do
- how we choose to focus our attention is what determines our experience
    - like time, it can be thought of as a limited resource that, if not used, dissipates
    - and even if used, it can be easily used incorrectly
- the self is the sum total of our experiences and consciousness so far
    - but hey, if the self drives the attention, and then attention shapes the consciousness, which then shapes the self, then it's a circle!
    - indeed, and that's the good thing!
- when our goals are threatened, some amount of mental energy has to be diverted to deal with the threat --> psychic entropy
    - but: external events (setbacks) are just more information
    - it is us who give them their meaning
    - the same event can have vastly different meaning to different people
- on the other hand, when the information is congruent with our goals --> flow state
    - leads to a stronger, more confident self if you manage to invest your psychic energy the way you wanted to
    - if it happens often, the quality of life will increase (even if the external conditions are the same)
    - battle against the self == battle FOR the self, to establish control over your attention
- growth == mental complexity, which has 2 components:
    1) differentiation: specialized, individual
    2) integration: connection to others, the world
    - too much of either is bad (egotism vs. conformity)
    - again, finding a balance is key

## Chapter 3 - Enjoyment and the Quality of Life

- 2 ways to being happy:
    - change external conditions to match your goals
    - change your perception so that the existing external conditions can match your goals (the obstacle is the way)
- mild correlation between wealth and happiness
    - but it is found to be among the weakest factors
- pleasure is only good for _maintaining_ psychic order, not creating growth
    - itt kiemelni az élvezet és élvezet közti különbséget (pleasure vs. enjoyment)
    - they are just to restore order after physiological needs create entropy
- enjoyment = not necessarily pleasurable while it lasts, but leads to a better self
    - pleasure needs no attention, while enjoyment requires a lot
    - so from now on, we should focus on enjoyment
    - analogue to my reading habits: reading for fun was... well, more fun. But reading more attentively, taking notes, writing posts, etc. is much more enjoyable!
- study results: enjoyment is almost always described in the same way
    - across very different activities
    - across very different social variables
- 8 elements
    1) a challenging activity that requires skill
        - and is around the skill limit
        - too easy will be boring, too hard will be frustrating
    2) the merging of action and awareness
    3) clear goals
    4) immediate feedback
    5) concentration on the task at hand
        - corollary of 2)
        - no psychic energy left over for worrying about anything else
    6) a sense of exercising control
    7) loss of self-consciousness
        - not loss of self, not loss of consciousness, just a loss of being conscious of the self
        - special case of 5), but an important special case
        - the re-emerging self will be better afterwards (as in, the self we will return to be conscious about is no longer the self we started with, because it just did some growing in the meantime)
        - almost like self-transcendence, but with an interaction
        - religious or political zealotry is an imposed order, not an achieved one, so there's no opportunity for growth
    8) altered sense of time
- learning to "flow" is morally neutral
    - it can be used both for good and bad
    - but this is not a reason to avoid it, just a reason to be vigilant when using it

### Quotes

## Chapter 4 - The Conditions of Flow

- what are activities that often lead to flow?
    - play, art, pageantry, ritual, and sports are some examples
    - a categorization of "games"
        - agon -- based on competition
        - alea -- based on chance
        - ilinx -- based on altered perception
        - mimicry -- based on alternate realities
    - the flow "channel" is presented as an explanation of why the seeking of flow continually enhances the complexity of the self
    - religion and similar cosmic-scale consciousness ordering approaches were more popular, but nowadays (with our segmented and specialized sub-fields) we don't pay these areas as much attention as they would deserve
- how does culture contribute to flow?
    - comparisons are out of fashion (and rightly so, after how we treated a lot of other cultures believing that our ways were THE ways)
    - but the concept of flow can give an objective measure: how conducive is a society to creating flow experiences for its citizens?
    - culture ~ games analogy --> if a society is helping create a good kind of order so that its members experience flow often, then life becomes a big game
        - but if cultural defaults are not like this, nothing's stopping us from forming our own! (my note)
- how does our personality fit into the picture?
    - schizophrenia, attention disorder (too loose attention) vs. Excessive self consciousness or self-centeredness (too rigid)
    - external factors: environment, social (anomie [no rules] vs. alienation [too much rules], analogous to internal...)
    - even if healthy and in a good society, some have a better disposition to focus, leading to more frequent flow
    - a family context that already had most of the flow components naturally prepares for a better enjoyment of life
    - prison examples (Solzhenitsyn): if you find something you can sink your mental energy into, find aspects to control (however minor), you can set yourself free, no matter the external conditions
    - but (as almost always) this is trainable!

### Quotes

Potentiality does not imply actuality, and quantity does not translate into quality.

Viktor Frankl and Bruno Bettelheim, Bertrand Russell
--> People to look into

## Chapter 5 - The Body in Flow

- the lowest hanging fruit to add enjoyment is to actually learn to use your body
- and not just "fitness", either --> "Each sensory organ, each motor function can be harnessed to the production of flow"
- an elaborate example of how even something as trivial as walking can become flow inducing, if approached the right way
- a study shows that the less expensive or equipment-requiring and more body and attention-requiring an activity is, the happier you'll be
- flow in sex is similar, pleasure becomes enjoyment only when accompanied by the appropriate consciousness
    - could be trained, as an analogue to sport
- Eastern cultures are way ahead of the West in this (i.e., body-mind unity) regard
    - yoga can be thought of as one of the oldest systematic flow-producing activities
    - the end goals are different, but the way there is practically the same level of consciousness control
    - martial arts are similar
- but it isn't necessary to be active
    - just using the senses (if they are developed enough) can lead to flow
    - really seeing sights, really hearing music, really tasting food, etc.
    - music has a soothing, mind-ordering effect in practically every culture
    - but (again) it is not the _hearing_, it is the _listening_ (especially if analytic)
- becoming an "expert" in any of these is hard (we would be limited to a few per lifetime), but becoming a dilettante in each is quite possible
    - this does imply only a superficial attention per area, but even that is infinitely better than the _none_ we usually pay

### Quotes

the rationale of all sports, which is to do something better than it has ever been done before.

enjoyment, as we have seen, does not depend on what you do, but rather on how you do it.

## Chapter 6 - The Flow of Thought

- as stated in the previous chapter, everything has to be mental (at least in part) to be enjoyable
    - but now we'll concentrate on purely (or mostly) mental stuff
- these have to be symbolic, mental manipulation of concepts
    - most obvious example is reading
- the natural state of our mind is chaos
    - when not distracted by external stimuli, our minds begin to drift
    - also, it tends to dwell on negative stuff often
    - that's why we are so susceptible to cheap distractions like TV
        - we don't have to face ourselves, but our mind is externally ordered for us without much effort
- memory is the base of everything
    - remembering stuff was key until just a few hundred years ago
    - even now it is far from useless
    - true, learning should not be solely based on this method anymore, but it would be a mistake to completely abandon it
    - connection to commonplacing: keeping worthwhile knowledge at hand (and eventually, in our head) leads to positive complexity
- on top of memory comes abstract, symbolic thinking that makes connections
    - no amount of memory would order our mental chaos if we didn't have a system to order our experiences
    - words and concepts (mental models) are really important in making sense of the world
    - thinking is (can be) pleasurable, despite modern science explaining it in purely extrinsic motivations
    - by connecting ideas and thinking, we "create a new way to describe reality"
    - symbolic systems (once learned well enough) can lead to portable, self-contained worlds within the mind
        - this can also be thought of as a defense against external forces (be they harsh environmental conditions, demagogues, media, etc.)
- even better is using words for self-expression
    - word puzzles --> conversation --> poetry/prose
    - for intrinsic, consciousness ordering reasons (no money necessary)
- history = observing and recording events ordered by time
    - an important part of human life (towards the end) is achieving integrity
        - making a coherent history of our lives, our story
    - our perception of our own past is continuously edited
        - "the question is only whether we take creative control of the editing or not"
    - we can (and to a certain degree, probably _should_) all become amateur historians in some areas
- basically the same with science, or at least, scientific thinking
    - there are areas that don't depend on labs or equipment
    - the mental framework is open
    - if flow is the measure instead of fame/fortune, then you can freely "allow" yourself to be an amateur scientist in certain areas
- and again with philosophy
    - we should recognize that the basic questions (which are universally applicable to anyone) are actually accessible
    - the over-institutionalization of it is just like any other discipline, and shouldn't deter the aspiring amateur to delve right in
- amateur and dilettante are _not_ pejorative
    - a lot of great scientists/thinkers were not professionals in their field
    - the point (yet again) is intrinsic vs. extrinsic
    - if you become an amateur at something to compare to the pros, or to advance some agenda, you're doing it wrong
    - is should be used to extend your own mental skills and complexity
    - a firm skepticism and critical thinking is necessary to not get "corrupted" on the way
- lifelong learning is the key!
    - the end of externally motivated learning (i.e., school) should not be the end of learning, only the beginning of the internally motivated phase
    - instead of grades, we can now focus on questions that really matter

### Quotes

## Chapter 7 - Work as Flow

- if you find work you want to do anyway, it becomes undistinguishable from free time
    - work is only bad if it's an external compulsion
- it's true not only in rural contexts, either
    - even urban, low-level workers can find meaning like this
    - distinguishing what one _can_ change and changing it is what leads to more complex and enjoyable experiences (instead of resigning ourselves to the whole of reality as unchangeable)
    - plus, the investment of psychic energy leads to a feeling of having chosen the activity freely (even if just the "how" of it, not the "what")
- eastern equivalent of work flow is _Yu_
    - western tries to change objective conditions by approaching the task with more conscious skill
    - eastern approaches it with spirituality, natural/automatic grace
    - one interpretation is that these are not so different at all: continuously learning and improving leads to a state that can seem (and feel) somewhat spiritual and automatic through skill
- another way to support work flow is of course changing jobs
    - or, at least, redesigning jobs to more closely resemble the flow structure
    - but this (while sometimes helpful) is not enough in itself, without the accompanying personality
- it is paradoxical that even flow-producing work is often regarded more poorly than non-flow-producing leisure time
    - we think of work as something that we _have to_ do, so even if it's good for our sense of accomplishment, we discredit it because it's not for our own goals, but someone else's
    - but this should again be solvable with a mental shift
- the even bigger problem is that leisure is intrinsically un-structured, so mostly non-flow-producing
    - we would need to impose our own structure on it, which we fail to do

### Quotes

“The future,” wrote C. K. Brightbill, “will belong not only to the educated man, but to the man who is educated to use his leisure wisely.”

## Chapter 8 - Enjoying Solitude and Other People

- our relationships with people are the other big factor in happiness (besides work)
    - yet we need to be able to be alone effectively as well
- we are social creatures (which has obvious evolutionary roots)
    - studies consistently show that we're the happiest when included
    - but relationships are usually also the causes of the worst depressions
    - the rules of interactions are malleable, if we have the skills
- solitude is hard mostly because internal order is hard
    - when we have external stimuli, it's easier to structure our time
    - bearing solitude without boredom or mental entropy is a good indicator of control
    - many make do with the bare minimum amount of inner discipline, which leads to cruise control for the rest of their lives
    - _how_ we deal with solitude is very important (drugs/tv vs. reading/routine) --> it has to be voluntary, positively regarded, and complex
- family is increasingly what we want it to be
    - external constraints are disappearing, which is good
    - internal acceptance of compromises is alive and kicking, which is not
    - only making a conscious decision and sticking with it leads to anything enjoyable (and frees up a lot of mental energy in the process)
    - generally, you reap what you sow
        - if you put in enough time and attention to get to know the other person better (or formulate common goals, or find common activities) you relationship will be better
    - regarding children, you should be an example, not just expect them to magically turn out fine
        - providing unconditional love and a safety net instead of strict measurement according to your own values
        - there have to be consequences, but concern should never be in question
- friendships are more naturally "fun" because they are usually based on shared goals
    - this is usually the context in which we can "let our hair down"
        - every other area expects us to behave a certain way
    - but they require the same kind of work to really provide enjoyment
        - keeping a circle of friends into adulthood is very rare
- as for the wider community, complexity is all around
    - if our goals are selfless (like helping others or providing an example), there's almost infinite chance at growth
        - if, however, we do it for selfish, material reasons, it probably won't make us happy (even if we reach our goals) because those goals are usually much less complex --> less opportunity for flow

### Quotes

“Whosoever is delighted in solitude,” goes the old saying that Francis Bacon repeated, “is either a wild beast or a god.”

## Chapter 9 - Cheating Chaos

- enhancing experience is not the icing on the cake, it _is_ the cake
    - conditions are rarely ideal, but that doesn't mean that controlling ourselves is not the most important thing to strive for
- hardships (while undeniably negative) are often also described as positive
    - they help to show what's important, and eliminate the "noise"
- how we deal with stress --> coping style
    - plus external support + psychological resources, but these last two are not really under our control
    - coping style = _mature defense_ (transformational coping, "the obstacle is the way") vs. _neurotic defense_ (regressive coping)
- dissipative structures = systems that harness energy that would otherwise be lost
    - our minds have to be like this to use any and all available resources to solve our problems
    - 3 steps for transformational coping
        - unselfconscious self-assurance
        - focusing attention on the world
        - the discovery of new solutions
- my main takeaway here is that we don't necessarily have to wait for one of these "wake up calls" to reap the same benefits of having our values corrected and aiming for internal order instead of anything external
- personality summary: choosing your own goals, developing the appropriate skills, cultivating concentration, getting rid of self-consciousness, being sensitive to feedback, getting involved
    - wherever you start, it leads to the same flow
    - and they help each other anyway
    - interaction over self-interest

### Quotes

as Dr. Franz Alexander has so well stated: “The fact that the mind rules the body is, in spite of its neglect by biology and medicine, the most fundamental fact which we know about the process of life.”

## Chapter 10 - The Making of Meaning

- it is desirable to turn our whole lives into a big flow activity
    - instead of moving from one kind of flow to the next (even if we can achieve flow)
    - harmonious goals and overall purpose > piecemeal enjoyment and a disconnected set of achievements
- life doesn't have a default, built-in, one size fits all meaning
    - but that shouldn't mean that life can't be _given_ meaning
- the meaning of life is _meaning_, where the 3 meanings of "meaning" are:
    - end, purpose, significance, goal (what is the meaning of life?)
    - intentionality (someone means to do something)
    - ordering information, relationships (red sky in the evening means good weather in the morning)
- using these (purpose, resolution, harmony), one should
    - find a purpose that unifies one's goals,
    - translate that purpose into intentional action,
    - and (through the first two) find harmony
        - no more cognitive dissonance --> inner congruence --> inner strength and serenity
        - feelings, thoughts, and actions are all congruent with each other
- societal meaning systems can be divided into cyclical epochs, and in each one, a different set of priorities justify the goals of existence
    - sensate - satisfy the senses, utilitarian, focuses on _concrete_ needs
    - ideational - focuses on _abstract_ principles, asceticism, transcendence
    - idealistic - the golden middle road, trying to combine the positive aspect of material and ideational systems while avoiding their pitfalls
        - purely materialistic views vs. fanatic asceticism
- another way of categorization is by complexity
    - a complex sensate view is better than an unreflective idealism, and vice versa
    - differentiation (nodes in the graph, inward attention) + integration (edges, outward attention) are both needed
    - complexity spiral (with alternating inward/outward attention)
        - survival (inward)
        - community (outward)
        - reflective individualism (inward)
        - unity with universal values (outward)
- you have to pay the price
    - at first, the goal justifies the effort, but later, the effort (so far) justifies the goal
- two possible paths to harmony
    - active life: chasing a goal so single-mindedly, that everything else seems to lose its importance
        - indirect way to prevent inner chaos
        - postponed (or ignored) goals may come back to haunt later
    - contemplative life: reflection, weighing of options and consequences
        - direct way to prevent inner chaos
        - without action, however, reflection is "impotent"
- less complex systems might be ordered by default, but it's too late for us
    - chaos is inherent in our complex consciousness
    - we just have to _make_ our order (as opposed to having it imposed on us)
- authentic vs. inauthentic life themes
    - again, analogues to intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation
    - another way to see it: discovered vs. accepted life scripts
    - each way has drawbacks, however:
        - accepted is only as good as the script you're given
        - discovered may be too incompatible with others'
- there are so many sources (teachers, books, models) of how harmony can be imposed on chaos (art, philosophy, religion)
    - ignoring it is like reinventing the wheel
- the main problem of our time can be thought of as too much differentiation and not nearly enough integration
    - this is what's destroying the planet


### Quotes

Few things are sadder than encountering a person who knows exactly what he should do, yet cannot muster enough energy to do it.

Action by itself is blind, reflection impotent.







# Notes -- becsempészni valahova, ha passzol...

- this notion of "escape from the external dependence" could be a good starting point for my own research re: philosophies/religions and finding common traits (to arrive at that greatest common divisor kind of idea...)
- I like how if there's an enumeration coming, it is kind of announced beforehand
    - like what is needed for flow are a, b, and c; and only then comes a more in depth description of a, b, and c.
    - so you can pre-cache the structure, and makes it easier to follow during the in-depth phase
- the yoga progression in chapter 5 is really cool (almost like an anime level up sequence)
    - definitely gotta check out yoga more seriously in the future
    - not that I wouldn't have anyway
- the overarching tone on Chapter 8 about how everyone wants to avoid being alone is a little strange from an introvert perspective, but I guess this is what's more common
- with a more long-range overview of history, I'm starting to think that my problem is not _mainly_ with accepting cultural norms, but that our generation's cultural norms are shit
    - blindly following anything is not okay at all, but a customized/personalized following wouldn't be too bad -- if the recipes weren't so disgusting nowadays
